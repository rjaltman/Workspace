# Workspace
A personal playground for various applications not related to IndigoBox, LC-3, Gainsboro, or other listed projects.

<b>Listings are thrown together in a date-organized manner, unless a certain activity becomes important enough to bear a name.</b> These kinds of listings appear in the folder named "Time-Listed" for reference.

# Why use Workspace?
I typically go around from various areas working on things, and this allows me to publish and track some solutions I put together, most of which I am happy to share with the open-source community. This also serves as a ground for tracking projects that perhaps start as "small ideas" (like Snowshoes), yet grow up into later projects with their own repositories.
